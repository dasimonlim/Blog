# 1.	Original Visualisation

![](DataViz3 Pics/OriginalViz.png)

# 2.	Critiques and Suggestions on Original Visualization

**2.1 Clarity**

|     Critique  | Suggestions |
|---------------|-------------|
|     The visualization is unable to provide further clarity/breakdown on the type of sub-events that occur. |  To include variable information in charts and tooltips.|
|     The event location dots overlap each other when all the events are chosen. i.e. the Battles (blue) event will cover any others below. Thus unable to visualise the actual events happening in the area.  |     To consolidate events into state level events for better visualization and less cluster on map.    |
|     Unable to know which state/area the event has happened in. Only the latitude and longitude are shown in tool tip.  |  To include necessary variable information in charts and tooltips.|


**2.2 Aesthetics**

|     Critique   |     Suggestions  |
|----------------|------------------|
|     The y-axis of the line chart which stated “Count of Sheet1” is not properly titled. |     To provide  appropriate title to the axis to explain the chart.  |
|     The color scheme used for the difference event type is not optimal. i.e. Riots and  strategic developments color shade is very close.     |     To ensure color theme used is visible and able to be easily differentiated.   |
|     The event location dots are cluttered covering the country names. No way of seeing  which dots are on which country other than via the country filter.   |     To consolidate   events into state level events for better visualisation and less clustered on map.    |


**2.3 Interactivity**

|     Critique   |     Suggestions    |
|----------------|--------------------|
|     Country filtering is done through a typical map filter function on the dashboard.  |     To use dashboard actions to allow interactive filtering of countries. |
|     There is no way of comparing event changes for a certain reference year through the event type chart.  |     To create reference year choosing function directly on the chart to allow comparison between multiple reference years.    |


# 3.	Proposed Visualisation

**3.1 Sketch**
	
![](DataViz3 Pics/Proposed Viz.png)
	
**3.2 Advantages of New Visualisation**

The new visualisation will be able to provide a better general overview of the conflict event situation in South East Asia through the choropleth map. Detailed information on events that occurred in each state will also be shown. By clicking on the country name on the dashboard, the specific country will be chosen and charts will change according to the chosen country, allowing more insights to be obtained. The two charts will be able to provide information not available in the original visualisation.

Interactivity wise, the percentage change of events over the time period can be shown with a reference year which can be chosen by clicking any data point for that year in the chart. Changing the reference year will at the same time change the year parameter of the map, switching it to the reference year. The top 5 sub events that occurred in each country can also be shown in the charts provide details on the fatalities that occurred in those events. 


# 4.	Data Visualisation Steps

**4.1	Data Source**

The data used was obtained from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED). The datafiles contain dates, actors, locations, fatalities, and types of all reported political violence and protest events across Southeast Asia.

**4.2	Data Preparation in Tableau**

1)	The data set “Southeast-Asia_2010-2020_Oct31” was dragged into Tableau and fields were checked for discrepancy. 

2)	The unrelated fields are selected and hidden.
![](DataViz3 Pics/Prep1.png)

3)	The variable “Admin1” was renamed as “State” and changed its geographic role to “State/Province” as shown. 
![](DataViz3 Pics/Prep2.png)

**4.3	Geographic Map**

1)	A calculated field called “Number of Events” is created as shown. 
![](DataViz3 Pics/Country1.0.png)

2)	The “Longitude” measure was dragged to column and “Latitude” measure to rows
![](DataViz3 Pics/Country2.png)

3)	The “Country” measure was dragged to Detail card and “Number of Events” was dragged to the Color card. <br>
![](DataViz3 Pics/Country3.png)

4)	To create another map layer above the current choropleth map, the “State” measure is dragged onto the map as shown. <br>
![](DataViz3 Pics/Country4.png)

5)	The “State” measure is dragged to the Detail card, and the “Number of Events” to the Size card. This is to consolidate the number of events happening at a state level. <br>
![](DataViz3 Pics/Country5.png)

6)	The color, size and opacity of the circle is adjusted.<br>
![](DataViz3 Pics/Country6.png)

7)	For the “Country” layer, “State” measure was dragged into tooltip and changed to count distinct. <br>
![](DataViz3 Pics/Country7.png)

The tooltip was edited as shown.<br>
![](DataViz3 Pics/Country8.png)

8)	For the “State” layer, “Country” measure, “Admin3” measure, “Event Interactions and fatalities” sheet and sheet were inserted into the tooltip. 
![](DataViz3 Pics/Country9.png)

9)	A calculated field “Year Filter” is created and dragged to filter card. 
![](DataViz3 Pics/Country10.png)

10)	Standardized font to Tableau Book and font color of axis.


**4.4	Event Interactions and fatalities Sub Chart**

1)	A new calculated field called “Type of Interaction” is created to differentiate whether the event occurred only has one party or two parties. 
![](DataViz3 Pics/Party1.png)

2)	“Type of Interaction”, “Event Type” and “Sub Event Type” were dragged to rows. 
![](DataViz3 Pics/Party2.png)

“Sub Event Type” was also dragged to Filters card, to show the Top 5 records. 
![](DataViz3 Pics/Party2.1.png)

3)	“Fatalities” and “Number of Events” measure is dragged to Text with the mark card.
![](DataViz3 Pics/Party3.png)

4)	Standardize font to Tableau Book and font color of axis.


**4.5	Fatalities By Year**

1)	The “Year” measure was dragged to columns and “Fatalities” to rows. <br>
![](DataViz3 Pics/Fatal1.png)

2)	“Sub Event Type” and “Country Filter” were dragged to Filters card, to show the Top 5 records and also dragged to color. <br>
![](DataViz3 Pics/Fatal2.png)

3)	Another “Fatalities” measure was dragged to rows to create a dual axis chart. The second chart is changed to a “circle” type under the mark card. The axis is also synchronized.

![](DataViz3 Pics/Fatal3.png)

4)	A reference line is added to show event with highest number of deaths.<br>

![](DataViz3 Pics/Fatal4.png)

5)	Grid lines were removed. <br>

**4.6	Percentage change in Events by Period**

1)	Next chart is to be able to show the percentage change on the number of events based on reference year. First, a parameter called “Year Parameter” was created.<br>

![](DataViz3 Pics/Change1.png)

2)	A calculated field called “Value for Year Parameter” is created. 

![](DataViz3 Pics/Change2.png)

3)	A calculated field called “% Change vs selected Year” is created. 

![](DataViz3 Pics/Change3.png)

4)	To be able to select the reference year on the chart, a parameter action “Change Year Parameter” is created via Worksheet-->Actions-->Add Action-->Change Parameter. 

![](DataViz3 Pics/Change4.png)

5)	The “Year” measure is dragged to columns and “% change vs selected year” is dragged to rows.<br>
<img src="DataViz3 Pics/Change5.png" width="300" height="100" />


“Event Type” measure is dragged to both color and detail card, and “% change vs selected year” is dragged to label. The label is changed to show the percentage change at the line ends.<br>

# 5.	Final Visualisation
![](DataViz3 Pics/Final Viz.png)

# 6. Main Observations

1)	In 2020, most of the conflict events occurred Indonesia, Philippines and Myanmar.  Laos was the lowest with 3 conflict events that occurred.
![](DataViz3 Pics/Observation1.png)

2)	Since 2016, “Violence against civilians” and “explosions/remote violence” has been dropping at an increasing rate. While “Riots”, “Protests” and “Strategic development” events has been on a general rising trend. 
![](DataViz3 Pics/Observation2.png)

3) There is a huge spike in “Violence against Civilians” in 2016 from 2015 with an increase of 1025%. This is mainly due to events that occurred Calabarzon, Central Luzon and the National Capital region in the Philippines. 
![](DataViz3 Pics/Observation3.png)

4) The high number of fatalities in 2017 due to battles in Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of the Philippines, contributing to 1513 deaths of the 2139 deaths in that year. 
![](DataViz3 Pics/Observation4.png)

5) The fatalities from battles in Myanmar seemed to follow a four-year cycle, peaking at 2011, 2015 and 2019.
